# TFM_Luis_Cervera
These folder contains all the scripts employed for the Master's Thesis of the MSc in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid (UAM).
They are distributed as follows:
  
  ## 1. Filtrado_RFAM_y_graficos_cuentas: 
   Contains the initial script that removes any sRNA aligning to the RFAM database using bowtie. This database is composed of sRNAs that cannot perform a function in stress tolerance in plants, such as transfer RNA or ribosomal RNA. It uses as input the cleaned sRNA libraries filtered by quality obtained from the FASTQ files.
   
   ## 2. RPMs: 
   Normalises the read counts associated to the RFAM-filtered sRNA libraries.
   
   ## 3. PCA:
   
   ## 4. miRNA_hairpin_precursor_alignment
   
   ## 5. Heatmaps
   
   ## 6. sRNA_precursor_alignment
   
   ## 7. Differential_expression
   
   ## 8. Conectividad_miRNAs
   
   ## 9. antagonismo:
